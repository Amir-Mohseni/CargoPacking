# Cargo Packing



## A fully functional application that helps putting containers of type A(2x2x4), B(2x3x4), and C(3x3x3), or Pentomino blocks in a container

This project helps with finding different ways to pack cargo in a container. It has two options: 1) Maximizing profits and 2) Maximizing total space covered
The application gives the user the option to pick the approach and by default, the values for the profits of the blocks are 3, 4, and 5 for types A, B, and C respectively.
